<h2>What is Recordz?</h2>
Recordz is a site for music collectors, where users can add bands' and artists' records to their own collection. They may create new records, bands and artists and that way make the Recordz-record collection an epicly fun site to collect your own music!

<h2>How to use</h2>
Users must create an account and log-in to Recordz in order to add or change their own-, band-, record- or artist information. Otherwise they may only view the records, bands, artists and music collectors collections. 

<b>Once logged in:</b>
Adding a new band, artist or record is easy. Just head to the Records, Artists or Bands page and click the New record/artist/band button. Fill out the form and it's done! 

Records can be added to own collection by heading to Records page. Find the record you wish to add and click the name of the wanted record. There you will find an "Add Record to Collection" button, click it and you have the record in your collection. To remove a record from collection follow the same steps but press the "Remove from collection" button.

Users can edit their bio and delete their usership in their own page. 

<h2>Testing & Datamodel</h2>

The testing has been done in 3 sections:

1. Console and interface(site) based testing after changes to database, site or function
2. Unit testing by using Rspec: Only models have been tested with rspec. The site functionality has been tested through the interface.
3. User testing with the help of friends (Thank you!)
