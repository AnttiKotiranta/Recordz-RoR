With Recordz users can add bands and artists records to their own collection. They may create new records for bands and artits and that way make the Recordz-record collection an epicly fun site to collect your own music!

HOW TO USE
Users must create an account and log-in to the Recordz in order to add or change their own, band, record or artist data. Otherwise they may only view the record, band and artist collection.
