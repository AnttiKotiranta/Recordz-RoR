<h2>What is Recordz?</h2>
With Recordz users can add bands and artists records to their own collection. They may create new records for bands and artits and that way make the Recordz-record collection an epicly fun site to collect your own music!

<h2>How to use</h2>
Users must create an account and log-in to the Recordz in order to add or change their own, band, record or artist data. Otherwise they may only view the record, band, artist and music collectors collection. 

<b>Once logged in:</b>
Adding a new band, artist or record is easy. Just head to the Records, Artists or Bands page and click the New record/artist/band button. Fill out the form and it's done! 

Records can be added to own collection by heading to Records page. Find the record you wish to add and open the records own page, click the Add Record to Collection button and it's done.

Users can edit their bio, collection and delete usership in their own page. 

<h2>Testing & Datamodel</h2>
More info about the testing will be added later.
